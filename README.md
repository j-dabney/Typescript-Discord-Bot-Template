# Typescript Discord Bot Template

This is a Discord Bot Template made by JD.
It will be actively updated and maintained.
Important information down below.

## What This Template Uses

This template is setup with MongoDB as the DB using mongoose.
It is also going to be setup for Linux use, but I will try to include notes where Windows specific changes are needed. (package.json being one example)
Currently, it's setup with a few very basic commands and a very basic structure to be the framework for your new bot. I plan on making many updates.

**The current state is rushed and temporary, as I need to continue with another project, but I will make an announcement when it's actually in a working state.**

### Dependencies

This template is currently setup using the following dependencies:
- discord.js
- dotenv
- mongoose
- glob
-- Convenience dependency used in BotTemplate/src/base/classes/Handler.ts
- typescript (dev)

## Future Plans

I would like to add A LOT more comments explaining certain aspects.
I'm also planning on refactoring in a few areas.
Going to also add depracation functionality to commands, as well as *eventually* add Prisma as an option in the DB.
I'm also going to make a Github Workflows folder with a few template files for easy hosting.

Have any questions or critiques/advice, feel free to let me know!!
